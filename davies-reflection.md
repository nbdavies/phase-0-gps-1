What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't particularly aware of my own shortcomings, because I had mainly been sticking to instructions. This session helped get me off the normal track and try some things without knowing quite what they would do. Like fetch and merge, or using the branch command to create branches, or using the --oneline argument with git log. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I definitely became more familiar with what exactly a merge does, how we've been using it up to this point, and what constitutes a merge conflict.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We did look to our guide for clarification on some of the git concepts, like how "fetch" differs from "pull", and why you might do a merge on GitHub rather than using the "merge" command locally.

What still confuses you about git?

The terminology is still a little unintuitive for me. But I think I'm getting an overall grasp of how it is supposed to work. Where I think I could learn more is maybe how the simple version of the git/GitHub workflow can become more complicated, or what things can go wrong and how to deal with them.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was really interesting. I felt like the guide and the pair both brought really useful knowledge, and we had a good time and kept things moving along pretty well. There were parts we didn't get to in the alloted time; it seems getting to the very end would have been a challenge, and we would've both needed to know exactly what to do every step of the way. But I think explaining things to each other and a bit of trial and error might have been more helpful anyway.
