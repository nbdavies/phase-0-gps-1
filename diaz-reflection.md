#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was confused about the idea of feature branches and how wwe merge them into the master branches and what kind of conflicts can occur.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS session?

The concepts of merging branches and how great they can be for trying out new faetures.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I was struggling with which we were were supposed to push to our remote repository, the master or the branch. I realized after clarification from the guide and my pair that it was only the branch, so that collaborators in the project can confirm the changes.

#What still confuses you about git?

The attributes for each command. But I feel like it will just come to me in time and with practice.

#How was your first experience of pairing in GPS?

I really enjoyed it. My biggest concern about trying to learn web development on my own, was the lack of collaboration. I like to bounce ideas off of other people, and ask questions and arrive at answer together. Thats what the GPS session allowed me to do. Ask questions and clarify anything that was troubling me.
